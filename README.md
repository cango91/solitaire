# Solitaire (Klondike)

Welcome to the world of Solitaire!

Also known as Patience or Klondike, it is a single player game played with a standard 52-card deck without Jokers. After shuffling, a tableau of seven fanned piles of cards are laid from left to right, each pile containing one more card than the last. The first pile on the left contains a single face-up card, the second pile contains two cards,  third pile three cards and so on... The top-most card of each pile is turned face up.

**Did you know:**
- Any game one can play by themself is called Solitaire, but in North America and many other places, Solitaire will almost always refer to Klondike in the absence of qualifiers
- The probability of being able to win a game of Klondike with best-possible play is not known: [Mathemagician Persi Diaconis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persi_Diaconis) described this phenomenon as *"one of embarrassments of applied probability"* [*](https://web.archive.org/web/20041216141330/http://www.math.washington.edu/Seminars/Archives/coll1998-1999.php)
- In 1994 it was said by Microsoft officials that *Solitaire was the most-used application for Windows* [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)#cite_note-28)

## For devs

The following classes and instances are assigned to the `window` for easy debugging, if you encounter any bugs they might come in handy for investigating:
```javascript
//---- DEBUGGING -----//
window.Card = Card;
window.Waste = Waste;
window.Deck = Deck;
window.Tableau = Tableau;
window.Foundation = Foundation;
window.Pile = Pile;
window.Solitaire = Solitaire;
window.Renderer = Renderer;
window.renderer = renderer;
window.solitaire = solitaire;
window.setPreventDragging = (val) => preventDragging = val;
window.EventSys = eventSystem;
window.getSortedEventHistory = (descending=true) => {
    const entries = Object.entries(eventSystem.eventDataHistory);
    // sort the inner arrays first
    entries.forEach(entry => entry[1].sort((a, b) => descending ? b.time-a.time : a.time-b.time));
    //then outer
    entries.sort((a,b)=> descending ? b[1][0].time - a[1][0].time : a[1][0].time-b[1][0].time) //forEach(entry=>entry.sort((a,b)=>a[1].time - b[1].time));
    return entries;
}
```
The `EventSys` is a singleton that tracks most going-ons in the game. However, by default it doesn't keep history. Use `EventSys.saveHistory = true` to enable it at anytime.
